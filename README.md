### üìã Project Overview

- **Flight Controller Software**: [PX4 Pro](https://px4.io/)
- **Ground Control**: [QGroundControl (QGC)](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/en/)
- **Primary Function**: Assist in navigating earthquake-stricken areas and guide trapped individuals using visual signals on an 8x8 LED matrix display.

### üìè Key Calculations

#### 1. Thrust Calculation
- Total thrust (T_total) = weight of the drone + payload capacity
- Weight of drone = 1200 grams
- Thrust per motor = 850 grams
- Total thrust = 4 √ó 850 = 3400 grams

#### 2. Payload Capacity Calculation
- Payload capacity (P_load) = total thrust - weight of the drone
- P_load = 3400 - 1200 = 2200 grams

#### 3. Flight Time Estimation
- Battery capacity = 2200 mAh
- Average current draw = 15A
- Estimated flight time = (2200 √ó 60) / 15000 ‚âà 8.8 minutes

#### 4. Propeller Selection
- Propeller size = 10x4.5 inches
- Thrust per propeller = 850 grams

## Project Overview

This project leverages the **ESP32** microcontroller to control a **NeoPixel 8x8 LED matrix display**. Users can connect to the ESP32's WiFi access point and use a web-based interface to manage the display settings. The ESP32 runs as a standalone access point, enabling remote control from any WiFi-enabled device.

---

## üì¶ Libraries and Constants

```cpp
#include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <WebServer.h>

#define LED_PIN 27
#define NUM_LEDS 64
```

- **Adafruit_NeoPixel**: Library for controlling NeoPixel LED displays.
- **WiFi** and **WebServer**: Libraries for handling ESP32's WiFi capabilities and serving a web interface.
- **LED_PIN**: The GPIO pin connected to the LED strip.
- **NUM_LEDS**: Total number of LEDs in the matrix.

---

## üì° WiFi Access Point Setup

```cpp
const char* ssid = "ESP32_LED_Display";
const char* password = "123456789";

WiFi.softAP(ssid, password);
```

The ESP32 is configured as an access point:
- **SSID**: "ESP32_LED_Display"
- **Password**: "123456789"

This allows users to connect directly to the ESP32 network to control the LED display.

---

## üñºÔ∏è LED Matrix Character Map

```cpp
const uint8_t charMap[40][8] = {
  // Each 8-byte array represents a character's binary map for the LED matrix.
};
```

The **charMap** array stores binary data for each character in the display. Each 8-byte array corresponds to one character, defining its display pattern on the 8x8 LED matrix.

---

## üåê Web Server Configuration

### Web Page Design

The ESP32 hosts a simple **HTML page with JavaScript** that includes buttons and controls for:
- **Displaying text**
- **Turning off the display**
- **Selecting colors and patterns**
- **Adjusting brightness**

```cpp
server.on("/", HTTP_GET, []() {
  String page = "<html>..."; // HTML and JavaScript for the control page
  server.send(200, "text/html", page);
});
```

This **root endpoint ("/")** serves the control page where users can interact with the LED matrix.

---

### üéõÔ∏è Control Actions

Display custom text on the LED matrix.

```cpp
server.on("/displayText", HTTP_GET, []() {
  inputText = server.arg("text").toUpperCase();
});
```

- **Description**: Converts input text to uppercase and sends it to the display.

#### 2. Turn Off Display
Turn off all LEDs on the matrix.

```cpp
server.on("/turnOff", HTTP_GET, []() {
  displayOn = false;
});
```

- **Description**: Deactivates the LED matrix display.

#### 3. Light Bar & Color Selection
Activate a light bar with a custom color.

```cpp
server.on("/lightBar", HTTP_GET, []() {
  lightBarColor = strtol(server.arg("color").c_str(), NULL, 16);
  lightBar = true;
});
```

- **Description**: Sets a chosen color on the LED matrix in a light bar pattern.

#### 4. Light Show
Start an animated light show.

```cpp
server.on("/lightShow", HTTP_GET, []() {
  lightShow = true;
});
```

- **Description**: Activates a predefined light show with cycling patterns.

#### 5. Rainbow Pattern üåà
Generate a colorful rainbow effect on the LED matrix.

```cpp
void rainbowPattern() {
  // Implementation of rainbow pattern here
}
```

- **Description**: Creates a mesmerizing rainbow effect across the LED matrix.
